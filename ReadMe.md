# Project Description

## Introduction

In this project, I'll take on the role of a Data Analyst tasked with analyzing fictional data from Reddit, a popular social news aggregation and content rating platform. Reddit allows users to create posts containing various types of content, including text, media, and links to external websites. These posts are shared within specialized interest-based communities called "subreddits," each of which focuses on a particular topic or theme. Users engage with content by upvoting or downvoting it, resulting in a cumulative score for each post.

## Data Tables

For this task, I have access to three key data tables:

1. **Users Table:** id, username, email, join_date, score

2. **Posts Table:** id, title, user_id, subreddit_id, score, created_date

3. **Subreddits Table:** id, name, created_date, subscriber_count


## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to extract valuable insights from the provided data. These insights will help in understanding user interactions, subreddit preferences, or any other patterns that may be present in the Reddit community. 

As I embark on this project, I'll ensure that I maintain a structured approach to data analysis, with well-documented work and clear presentation of findings to convey the story within the data.

### My work:

    -- Letâ€™s start by examining the three tables.
    
    SELECT *
    
    FROM users
    
    LIMIT  5;
    
      
    
    SELECT *
    
    FROM posts
    
    LIMIT  5;
    
      
    
    SELECT *
    
    FROM subreddits
    
    LIMIT  5;
